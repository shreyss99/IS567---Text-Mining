5/23/2023 14:48,"Not ""free to use""","The app wants not only an SSO (or sign-in account), but also name, birth telephone number, and I don't know what else, because I stopped there - before the user has looked at the app itself. I had the impression this was free to use, with an option to pay for services, should the user decide the app suits the user's needs. What's actually happening is they're draining data from you the moment you want to have a look.

I have no problem providing data to a service provider (despite the egregiously bad, vendor-skewed terms of service common to tech ventures of all sorts (which really should be mauled in court by competent attorneys)), provided I want the service and feel there may be benefit in paying for a service. Asking for personal data for which the the service provider has no reasonable use is simply not acceptable.

This is new technology. It's not at all clear this app will be of any use to me. So why do you want my phone number, when you already have an SSO signing of on my contact information? When I have no relationship to you, as yet? No.

This is a poor way to start a relationship, and it is full of presumption and entitlement. You are not alone in this. But if you are releasing this app with the intent of building a user base, at least from where I sit (obviously, many people will rush into any commitment with a tech company without a second thought, and you can get by on those people if you like), this approach tells me you may be a problem rushing to develop. It would be better business practice to pretend, at least initially, you respect the people you want to use your products. Even Google did that, way back when.

5/20/2023 0:33,Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Experience,"Review:
I regret to say that my experience with the ChatGPT app has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. I had high hopes for an intelligent and helpful AI assistant, but this app fell far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the app's performance was abysmal. The responses from ChatGPT were often nonsensical and lacked coherence. It frequently misunderstood my questions and provided irrelevant or inaccurate answers. This made any attempt at a meaningful conversation impossible, leaving me feeling more confused than before.

Furthermore, the app's usability was subpar at best. The interface was clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate and find the features I needed. It lacked basic functionalities that one would expect from a modern AI assistant app, such as the ability to save conversations or easily access previous interactions.

Even when it did manage to understand my queries, the responses often lacked depth and insight. ChatGPT seemed to provide generic, surface-level information without any real understanding or critical thinking. This severely limited its usefulness, especially when I sought detailed explanations or in-depth discussions.

In addition, the app's customer support was woefully inadequate. When I encountered issues or had questions about the app's functionality, I received generic and unhelpful responses. It was evident that the developers did not prioritize user satisfaction or promptly address user concerns.

Considering the high expectations and the potential of AI technology, the ChatGPT app failed to deliver a satisfactory experience. It was riddled with performance issues, lacked usability, and fell short in terms of providing meaningful and insightful interactions. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and intelligent AI assistant.",1

6/23/2023 18:57,Frustrating and Disappointing: A 1-Star Review for ChatGPT App,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using the ChatGPT app, and I must say it was incredibly disappointing. From start to finish, the app failed to meet even the most basic expectations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.

First and foremost, the app?€?s performance was subpar. It consistently struggled to understand and respond appropriately to my queries. The responses often seemed nonsensical, irrelevant, or simply lacked coherence. It felt like conversing with a bot that was trapped in a perpetual state of confusion.

Moreover, the app?€?s limited ability to handle context was a significant drawback. It frequently failed to maintain a coherent conversation thread, causing repeated misunderstandings and disjointed interactions. It lacked the ability to remember key details from previous exchanges, resulting in repetitive questions and disjointed replies that left me questioning its overall usefulness.

Another glaring issue was the app?€?s inability to grasp nuanced or complex queries. It often provided superficial and generic responses that felt like they were generated by a simplistic search engine rather than a sophisticated language model. It struggled with complex reasoning and failed to provide meaningful insights or deep understanding.

Furthermore, the app?€?s lack of empathy and emotional intelligence was highly evident. It failed to recognize and appropriately respond to emotional cues in the conversation. When expressing frustration or sadness, the app provided robotic and detached replies, further exacerbating my disappointment.

The app?€?s user interface also left much to be desired. It had a clunky design, with a convoluted menu structure that made navigation unnecessarily difficult. The overall user experience felt unintuitive and cumbersome, adding to the overall frustration of using the app.

Lastly, the lack of timely updates and improvements from the developers was disheartening. The app seemed stagnant, with no visible efforts to address the numerous flaws and enhance its capabilities. It gave the impression that customer feedback and satisfaction were low priorities.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app was a thoroughly frustrating and disappointing experience. Its poor performance, limited context handling, inability to grasp complex queries, lack of empathy, subpar user interface, and stagnant development efforts all contribute to its well-deserved 1-star rating. I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and coherent conversational experience.",1

7/9/2023 20:51,THE BEST CHAT GPT,Buy it.NOW,5
7/21/2023 15:22,Subscription ripoff,I subscribed to a whopping monthly fee of $19.99 After asking it 25 questions (after I paid for my subscription) it responded with ?€?You have sent too many messages to the model. Please try again later.?€?  Such a huge ripoff.,1
7/21/2023 6:35,"Not very good, and a bit insulting for $20/mo","This app has potential, particularly when it comes to integration with shortcuts. However, as a tool for working with ChatGPT, especially for Plus users, it leaves much to be desired.

Most disappointingly, the app cannot use extensions unless the session is initiated from a web platform, and there's no option to edit your previous inputs for regeneration.

The inability to revise and resend your previous prompts severely limits the app's effectiveness for prompt development since there's no option for an edit/regenerate cycle. If you phrase something incorrectly and receive an odd response, there's no mechanism to rectify it. This renders the app more suitable for casual and simple interactions rather than anything more serious or intensive. 

There?€?s also a terrible design flaw that to copy or select text?€?the only way to export your results because OpenAI only implemented Share for the entire chat, and only to give you a useless URL you can post on Reddit?€?you have to pick that mode from a long press menu first. I?€?m not sure they were clear that in iOS, Share is the *only* real way to pass stuff between apps, and they just?€?skipped it. 

And then these rocket scientists put the ?€?copy?€? and ?€?select text?€? commands right by the ?€?regenerate response?€? command. ?€?Regenerate response?€? completely jettisons and replaces the prior text?€?with no confirmation.

I can?€?t tell you how many times I?€?ve erased what I was trying to copy so I could save it. That also erases the whole downstream thread, and you have to risk that a bunch of times per thread if you want to export your response text because this is the only way to do it. Way to throw away my quota.

So this app is useless for the professional work I?€?m paying $20/mo for, but it?€?s just great for posting a chat full of parody song lyrics to Reddit. And that?€?s as far as OpenAI has thought about their costly service.

At home, there?€?s the severe issue that if you use the ChatGPT Conversation Shortcut from Siri on HomePod, there?€?s no way to end the conversation. They apparently only tested it on phones where you have buttons to push, and not on HomePod, where it all has to be done voice. Any command you try to give the HomePod to cancel the shortcut (Siri, stop) will be answered by ChatGPT (buzz off, I?€?m not Siri).

Worse, it?€?ll just listen forever, responding to any question within earshot, until it decides to time itself out if it doesn?€?t hear any words for a bit. If you thought Echo was bad about waking up and sending your conversation to Amazon by mistake, you ain?€?t seen nothing yet.  

Whoever designed this paid no attention to user experience, user privacy, or the Apple ecosystem, so I assume it was an intern project or something. I certainly hope they didn?€?t pay anyone for this because I?€?m pretty sad I?€?m paying them for this.  

OpenAI needs to step up their game if they?€?re going to sell access to end users for $20(!!!!!) a month. This app doesn?€?t cut it, and they should be at least a little ashamed it?€?s this mediocre after taking so long to develop it.",1
7/18/2023 22:47,Couldn?€?t create account,"Unfortunately, I didn?€?t get very far with this app. They require a phone number to open an account and use the app. I tried using my home phone and Google Voice-type number, but it wouldn?€?t accept it. I?€?d prefer to provide my email address or use Sign In with Apple, instead of giving my personal cell phone number to a company I don?€?t yet know or trust. I reluctantly gave my cell number, but then I never received the verification code despite numerous tries. I don?€?t think I?€?ve ever spent so much time trying to create an account somewhere and in the end it never worked.",1

6/13/2023 5:07,API for paid GPT4 feels buggy,"Either the limit for API calls to GPT4 are too low or something about the app causes it to often get stuck cooking up a response. 

It is very common for me to have to close the app, reopen it, open history, reopen the last conversation, and then ask the same question I asked before the app got stuck.

I used to wait for like 10 seconds before going through this. Now I've learned that if it takes more than three seconds to output anything, that likely won't change at 10 seconds, 20 seconds, etc.

Word to the wise: Respond to any delay that's not due to a poor signal by closing and reopening the app. Can't wait for this to change.

That said, AMAZING app for studying a new technology. Imagine the best professor you had in college (or best high school teacher) and then imagine being able to ask them as many probing questions as you want without feeling like you're being annoying or delaying the lecture. Also, speaking of lectures, I think it's easier for me to remember details of a conversation (active) than a lecture or YouTube tutorial (passive). Truly fascinating.",4

6/12/2023 21:20,Good app but needs some improvements,"The code syntax highlighting feature does not render optimally in dark mode, making it difficult to read and strain the eyes, especially during late-night coding sessions. Enhancing the contrast or offering customizable color schemes for syntax highlighting could significantly improve the user experience.

Furthermore, navigating to the chat history feels cumbersome, requiring multiple steps. A more streamlined process or a single-step access would greatly improve the app. Having an option to quickly review the conversation history would make it much easier to refer back to previous interactions, particularly with the amount of valuable information the AI provides.",4

I enter the phone number and jump through a lot of hoops to prove that I?€?m a real person and then tell the app to send the code but I never receive it.

I can personalize task categories, color code important items, and set priority levels, allowing me to stay focused on what matters most.

5/22/2023 0:17,"Good, and can become Great","First, I really like the app and I?€?m now using it constantly. Thank you so much for making the app!

Now, for some ideas. I think the app could be way better if it facilitated various specific user stories: 
- as a GPT Plus user, I have many chats, it?€?s challenging to find stuff in them, so it?€?s really scattered, and I wish I could search my chat logs. 
- as someone who works with GPT on code projects, it would be incredible to have some integrated literate notebook programming features like runnable cells (maybe the plugins could help)
- as someone who pushes GPT to the limit, I often hit issues with context window, so it would be extremely useful if the interface simply drew a thick red line in the chat log at the start of the context window so we could see exactly what information will be available for the response. Perhaps that line would move depending on how long our messages are
- as someone who doesn?€?t have access to GPT4 on the API or Playground yet, I really feel like I can?€?t use GPT to the fullest extent, so I really wish I could set a system message and control various parameters like the playground makes available; it would be incredible if the system messages integrated ideas from Microsoft/guidance repo automatically, so we could write prompt templates with the handlebars syntax in the system message to guide the response formatting more clearly and efficiently 
- as an apple watch wearer, I would be thrilled to be able to send a message to chatgpt by talking to my watch, especially if it were integrated with a complication or the action button
- as an Apple customer, I can see how chatgpt integration with the Shortcuts app would potentially be revolutionary; we could enable routines with this; 
- as a prompt engineer, it feels like a lot of flipping back and forth between this app and 1Writer (great app btw) to manage the prompts and paste them around; it would be nice to have a prompt library both personal and public and perhaps make it easy to toggle prompts between private by default and public for others, especially if it had great version history; then when the prompts are updated everyone can use the latest version easily
- a close family member of mine uses an iPad Pro a ton, and as an iPad Pro user, they would really love it if there were a real iPad UI to use the big screen to the fullest and not have to use the janky scaled-up iPhone app (which is less fun and impressive than this app deserves to be)
- finally, as an AI user, I think it would be great if I could plug in my own data sources to a vector database and connect that to chatgpt without needing a third party; I?€?d love to chat with my Evernote, notion, Dropbox, drive, web history, messages, basically I wish I could index all my data and search it to pull relevant chunks for gpt if needed.

I?€?m sure there are more ideas, but imho, if you guys implemented these, you?€?d have a professional level app and it would be even more revolutionary than it already is!

1. You cannot go back and edit prompts in a conversation. 
2. You cannot clear conversations.
3. Light/Dark theme is system based, there is no toggle.
4. No ?€?Chat History & Training?€? Setting in the settings.
5. No examples/capabilities/limitations in the background of a new chat.

That?€?s all  the features not present on the mobile version that I could find.
Some features that are new or different are:

1. A ?€?Haptic feedback?€? Setting
2. The box ChatGPT puts code, ascii, etc. is instead in a patch of tinted background.
3. Speech-to-Text.

Overall, not much is new/different. Some features from the web version are missing however. It?€?s ChatGPT however, so it gets 5 ??????. I would personally use the web version over the app as of now. This review doesn?€?t speak for the subscription features.

The AI?€?s proficiency in maintaining a conversational flow and its ability to comprehend and generate accurate responses is truly commendable.

However, I believe there is scope for improvement to make this great app even better. Firstly, it would be immensely beneficial to add a browsing feature. This would enable users to quickly cross-reference information within the app, enriching the overall user experience.

Secondly, supporting plug-ins would greatly increase the app?€?s versatility. It would allow users to customize their experience and adapt the app to a wider range of applications.

Lastly, incorporating a code interpreter would be a game-changer. This feature could aid users in debugging code, learning new programming languages, or even automating tasks.

In summary, ChatGPT is an excellent app that has revolutionized communication with AI. With a few enhancements, I believe it has the potential to become an indispensable tool for a vast array of users. Looking forward to seeing these updates soon!",5
